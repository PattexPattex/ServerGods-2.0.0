## This bot account is not public and can't be invited to servers.

Only the owner of this bot (the user who created the application) can invite this bot to other servers.

If you wish to use ServerGods yourself, you must create a Discord bot yourself over on [the developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Detailed instructions on how to create a bot can be found [on the JDA wiki](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki/3%29-Getting-Started#creating-a-discord-bot).

After you've created the bot, check out the [instructions](https://github.com/PattexPattex/ServerGods-2.0.0/blob/master/README.md#setup) for setting up ServerGods properly.
