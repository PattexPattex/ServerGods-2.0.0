# ServerGods
A not so simple custom discord bot made in Java, designed for my Discord server, but it could be used in other servers with the release of 2.1.0.
It is currently not out yet, but should be soon.

## Setup

To setup ServerGods for yourself, you must first create a Discord bot over on [the developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki/3%29-Getting-Started#creating-a-discord-bot).

After you've set up the bot and invited it to your server, download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/PattexPattex/ServerGods/releases/latest) page.
**Do not download the Source code.zip or Source code.tar.gz, unless you want to modify the bot's code.**

Download the **`ServerGods.jar`**, **`config.json`**, **`serverconfig.json`** and **`restart.py`** files and copy them over to a directory in which the files won't be deleted.

Next, open the `config.json` file. Fill out the values in the file with the token, activity, etc. You can also enable or disable specific commands globally. For more info, go [here]().

After you've filled everything, save and close the file. Open a Command Prompt and `cd` into the bot's directory. Execute the command `java -jar ServerGods.jar` and the bot should start normally. If there are no exceptions thrown, you've done everything correctly!

To enable commands per-server, go [here]().
